Description: This package provides functions to analyse state sequences with Probabilistic Suffix Trees (PST), the construction that stores Variable Length Markov Chains (VLMC). The PST library can be used to learn VLMC models and includes many additional tools and features to analyse sequence data with these models: new visualization tools, functions for model optimization, for sequence prediction and artificial sequences generation, context and pattern mining. The library also allows to fit segmented VLMC, where conditional transition probabilities are estimated and stored for each value of a covariate.
